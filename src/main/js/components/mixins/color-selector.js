 * This mixin is used by canvas items which feature a color selector.
 * It provides:
 * - color          the persisted color (as read from DB)
 * - selectedColor  the model for the color selector, initialized with "color"
 * - doCancel       a method to reset the color selector and leave form mode
 * Note: "color" and "selectedColor" may differ as long as the canvas item is not saved.
 *
 * The host component (a canvas item) is expected to hold
 * - topic          any topic which has an "Color" view property
