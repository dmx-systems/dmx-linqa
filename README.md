# DMX Linqa

Linqa is a platform for bilingual collaboration. Linqa provides shared workspaces for handling and commenting
on various kinds of content objects (documents, notes, textblocks). Content objects are freely placed on a workspace "canvas", and can be further decorated by headings and graphical elements. Every user input is automatically translated on-the-fly by the means of the [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) service.

The canvas is synchronized between collaborating users. There are 3 user roles: *administrators* (create workspaces and user accounts, manage memberships and user roles), *editors* (edit content objects and arrange the canvas), and *users* (browsing canvas content).

The pair of languages Linqa uses for automatic translation and for the UI is configurable per installation. At the moment 9 languages are supported:

| Code | Language               |
| ---- | ---------------------- |
| `de` | German                 |
| `en` | English                |
| `es` | Spanish                |
| `fi` | Finnish                |
| `fr` | French                 |
| `pl` | Polish                 |
| `pt` | Portuguese (Brazilian) |
| `sv` | Swedish                |
| `uk` | Ukrainian              |

Linqa is an application for the [DMX platform](https://github.com/dmx-systems/dmx-platform). Linqa is Open Source software under the GNU AGPL license. Linqa is the generalized version and subsequent derivate of the [DMX Zukunftswerk](https://github.com/dmx-systems/dmx-zukunftswerk) customer project.

## Installation

TBD

## Configuration

For Linqa to work it is mandatory to configure 2 languages and a DeepL API key. To do so add entries to DMX's `conf/config.properties` file. After editing the config file restarting the DMX platform is required.

| Property           | Required | Description                                               |
| --------           | -------- | -----------                                               |
| dmx.linqa.lang1    | yes      | ISO 639-1 language code, see table above. |
| dmx.linqa.lang2    | yes      | ISO 639-1 language code, see table above. |
| dmx.linqa.digest_email_subject | no | The string appearing in the subject of the digest emails sent by Linqa.<br>Default is `Linqa Platform`. |
| dmx.deepl.auth_key | yes      | Your DeepL API key as obtained from https://www.deepl.com |
| dmx.deepl.base_url | no       | DeepL API base URL. Includes version number, ends with `/`.<br>Default is `https://api-free.deepl.com/v2/`.<br>For the DeepL payed plan use `https://api.deepl.com/v2/` instead. |

All following configuration possibilities (Site logo, legal texts, ...) rely on file/directory naming conventions. In these cases restarting the DMX platform is *not* required.

### Site logo

You can provide a custom logo for your specific Linqa installation. If you don't provide a custom logo Linqa will show its default logo:

![linqa-logo.png](docs/linqa-logo.png)

The Linqa UI shows the logo at 3 dedicated spots:

- The Login page
- The legal pages (Imprint and Privacy Policy)
- The top header of the main Linqa UI

The logo is language sensitive. In an e.g. German/French Linqa installation you could have 2 individual logos:

![zw-logo.de.png](docs/zw-logo.de.png)
![zw-logo.fr.png](docs/zw-logo.fr.png)

The Linqa UI would then show the logo corresponding to the language currently selected by the user.

For each language you need to create a separate PNG file with name `logo` and put them in DMX's `conf/dmx-linqa/` directory:

```
logo.de.png
logo.en.png
logo.es.png
...
```

It is sufficient to provide the logo files for the languages configured for `lang1` and `lang2` respectively. If the logo file for the current UI language is missing Linqa will show its default logo. Note: if you want the *same* custom logo appear regardless of selected UI language you still need provide separate files then (just copies).

The logo files are expected to be PNGs. Other file types are not supported at the moment.

The logo PNGs should have an height of at least 84px. The width is arbitrary. Note: the respective language versions are *not* required to have the same width.

#### Logo style

Linqa's default stlyesheet will resize the logos to a height of 84px (Login and legal pages) resp. 44px (app header). To change this style or to add further style properties to your logo see *Custom CSS* below.

### Imprint and privacy policy

It is required to configure site-specific imprint and privacy policy texts.

To do so create a `dmx-linqa/` directory within your DMX `conf/` directory with this content:
```
imprint.de.html
imprint.en.html
imprint.es.html
...
privacy_policy.de.html
privacy_policy.en.html
privacy_policy.es.html
...
```

These files are supposed to contain HTML *fragments*, that is one or more `<p>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, ... elements. *No* `<html>` or `<body>` element.

It is sufficient to provide the language files as configured for `lang1` and `lang2` respectively.

### Email texts

TBD

#### Welcome email
#### New password email
#### Digest email
##### Digest email style

### Help texts

TBD

### Custom CSS

You can override/extend Linqa's default CSS styles by providing a custom stylesheet. To do so put a file named `custom.css` to DMX's `conf/dmx-linqa/` directory. This stylesheet will be loaded *after* Linqa's default style, thus allowing easy overriding the default rules.

Use the browser's inspector tool to investigate the Linqa markup and define your custom rules accordingly. Practically all Linqa page elements are equipped with class attributes, making them easily accessible for customization. The major elements use the `lq-` class prefix.

Examples:

```
.lq-login, .lq-app-header {
  background-color: white;      /* make Login page and main UI's header white instead of black */
}

.lq-login img.logo {
  filter: invert(100%);         /* apply a filter to Login page's logo */
  margin-left: -81px;           /* outdent Login page's logo */
}
```

Note: if you run Linqa in development mode (via webpack-dev-server) stylesheet loading order is different. In order to see effect while development you might need to add `!important` to your custom rules.

### Serving custom resources

Basically Linqa makes all files residing in DMX's `conf/dmx-linqa/` directory available to the web browser. So you can supply further resource files for your own purposes here. Resource files can be multilingual (individual files per language) or language independent.

In order to access your resource files use this URL format (e.g. inside your custom CSS):

```
/linqa/config/{file name}/{file type}
```

For multilingual resource files append a query parameter:

```
/linqa/config/{file name}/{file type}?multilingual=true
```

For example, to display a decorative image (`zw-snake.png`) on both, the Login and the legal pages:

1. Put the file `zw-snake.png` into DMX's `conf/dmx-linqa/` directory, and
2. Supply some custom CSS (see above):
   ```
   .lq-login, .lq-legal {
     background-image: url("/linqa/config/zw-snake/png");
     background-position: bottom right;
     background-repeat: no-repeat;
   }
   ```

Note: in the URL it's `.../zw-snake/png`, not `.png`. As explained above this URL will access the corresponding `.png` file then.

In case you want display a language specific image you'd have to 1) supply one file per language, and 2) use this URL: `.../zw-snake/png?multilingual=true`. This accesses the image corresponding to the selected UI language then:

```
conf/dmx-linqa/zw-snake.de.png
conf/dmx-linqa/zw-snake.en.png
conf/dmx-linqa/zw-snake.es.png
...
```

While the custom logo is limited to `PNG` files, for the custom resources you can use arbitrary file types.
