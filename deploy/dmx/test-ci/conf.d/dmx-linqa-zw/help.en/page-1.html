  The platform helps with overcoming language barriers by providing <b>shared workspaces</b>.
  A workspace comprises of both, a <b>whiteboard</b> on which texts, documents, videos, notes, and photos can be placed, and a <b>chat/discussion</b> panel.
</p>
<p>
  The contents of both, the whiteboard, and all chat/discussion messages are <b>translated automatically</b>.
  So everything happening on the platform is available in German and French instantly.

  Use the upper/right button to choose your preferred display language.
</p>
<p>
  There are 3 user roles: <b>users</b> can read/watch whiteboard contents, chat/discuss, and download documents. <b>Editors</b> put content items on the whiteboard and arrange them. <b>Administrators</b> can create workspaces and invite users to them.
