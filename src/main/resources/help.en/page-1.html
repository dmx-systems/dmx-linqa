<h3>Welcome</h3>
<h2>Welcome to the Linqa platform for bilingual collaboration!</h2>
<p>
  <img src="/linqa/config/help/ui-overview.png" class="float-left margin-top">
  The Linqa platform helps with overcoming language barriers by providing <b>shared workspaces</b>.
  A workspace comprises of both, a <b>whiteboard</b> on which texts, documents, videos, notes, and photos can be placed, and a <b>chat/discussion</b> panel.
</p>
<p>
  The contents of both, the whiteboard, and all chat/discussion messages are <b>translated automatically</b>.
  This means that everything that happens on the platform is immediately available in two languages.
  These two languages can be configured for each Linqa installation from a pool of nine languages.

  Use the upper/right button to choose your preferred display language.
</p>
<p>
  There are 3 user roles: <b>users</b> can read/watch whiteboard contents, chat/discuss, and download documents. <b>Editors</b> put content items on the whiteboard and arrange them. <b>Administrators</b> can create workspaces and invite users to them.
