<h2>Modifying whiteboard contents</h2>
<p>
  If you're an editor for the current workspace you can arrange the whiteboard items spatially, edit their text content, and modify their style.

  You can <b>move</b> items by dragging them.
  The upper/left item corner will snap to the whiteboard grid to support alignment with other whiteboard items.
</p>
<p>
  You can <b>resize</b> an item by clicking on it and then drag one of the 3 Resize handles.
  Use the mid-right handle to change width while <span class="hint">adjusting height <i>automatically</i></span> so that the text content fits perfectly.
  Use the 2 bottom handles to adjust height (and width) <i>manually</i> for proper alignment with other whiteboard items.
</p>
<p>
  You can <b>rotate</b> an item by dragging its Rotate handle.
</p>
<p>
  Use the <b>Edit</b> mode to edit the original text content and to request another <b>automatic translation</b>.
  You also can edit the translation result manually.

  <img src="/linqa/config/help/lock-icon.png" class="float-left margin-top">
  Administrators can <b>lock</b> individual items so they can no longer be modified by editors.
  For locked items both, editors and administrators see a lock symbol in the item's lower/right corner.
