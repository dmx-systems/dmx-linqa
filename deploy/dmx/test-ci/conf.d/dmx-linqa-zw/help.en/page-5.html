<h2>Creating whiteboard contents</h2>

  <img src="/linqa/config/help/add-menu.png" class="float-left">
  To put new items on the whiteboard use the Add button at the upper/left corner.
  <span class="hint">The Add button appears only if you're an editor for the current workspace.</span>
</p>
<p>
  A <b>Document</b> represents a file (or 2 language-specific ones) and a name.
  You can upload text/image/audio/video/PDF files.
  It will appear on the whiteboard along with the name.
  Audio and video files are playable.
</p>
<p>
  A <b>Note</b> is a more or less extensive text. It can be styled (bold, italic) and color marked.
  You can insert headlines, lists, web links, images, videos.
  On the whiteboard the text is displayed in the respective user's preferred language.

<p>
  <b>Textblocks</b> are similar to notes, but on the whiteboard both language versions are displayed at the same time.
  Textblocks are useful when working collaboratively on a longer bilingual text/document.
</p>
<p>
  The 3 remaining item types are supportive for structuring and decorating the whiteboard.
</p>
<p>
  A <b>Heading</b> is typically a single line of text, displayed with large letters and a transparent background.
  Basically you can do the same with a Note, but headlines are more easy to create as their style is fixed.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Shapes</b> and <b>Lines</b> offer you rectangles, ellipses, outlines, lines, dotted lines, arrows etc.
</p>
<p>
  Notes, textblocks, headings, and document names are translated automatically.
  For documents and textblocks a dedicated discussion panel is available.
